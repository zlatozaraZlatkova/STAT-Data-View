## Project Overview

Visualization of statistical data using Chart.js with Eurostat API integration.  
The project aims to provide dynamic and interactive charts for economic indicators, with a strong focus on reliable data transformation and clean, maintainable code structure.

### Key Features

- **Improve API parameter handling**
  Enhanced processing of input parameters for Eurostat API requests to ensure accurate data retrieval based on selected indicators and time periods.

- **Implement mapping layer for API responses**
  Introduced a mapping layer that converts Eurostat API responses into an internal format optimized for Chart.js visualizations.

- **Develop robust data transformation pipeline**
  Built a reliable pipeline for data transformation, including normalization, handling of missing values, and adaptation to different units and formats.

- **Create multi-axis chart with separate scales**
  Added support for multi-axis charts that allow visualization of different economic indicators with separate scales (e.g., percentages vs. absolute values) on a single diagram.

- **RSS Feed Integration**
  This implementation integrates an RSS feed into the application by converting XML data into JSON and exposing it through reactive streams. It keeps the news items up to date with RxJS, allows easy filtering or limiting to the latest entries, and ensures smooth navigation to both internal pages and external article links.
